# WallStreet Simulator

# Description

We were asked to create an app that uses two APIs. Our team created a stock trading website where you can trade stocks with simulated currency. There is a log in/sign up, a CBC feed, a NY Times trending news page, a real time stock search that shows price, change and shows a graph, and there is also a user portfolio where it shows what stocks you' purchased along with your remaining cash.

# User Story.

One of the best ways to learn is by applying your knowledge in a real life situation but using your knowledge to trade stocks is very risky. The stock market can also be very intimidating especially for newbies. This is where our app comes in. It uses real time data to simulate the stock market. You can buy and and sell stocks using virtual currrency. You can test various investment strategies without the risk of losing real money. Each user starts with $10,000 to invest. Users can view their investments in their portfolio to see the investments grow or shrink over time.  

## Issues

The main issues were figuring out how to use modals, figuring out how to implement a stock buying feature, and implementing the graph using chart.js.
The other issue was we encountered was when we were working with the API limitations, namely the limit of calls that could be made.
